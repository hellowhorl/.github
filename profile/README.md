# `term-world`

This project aims to apply gamification-as-pedagogy in design and development of an approach to  
introductory computer science (CS) courses in Python. The outcome, this persistent, immersive digital 
environment provides both a playground and persistent digital world, themed several different ways to provide
an analog to classic multi-user dungeons (MUDs) and contemporary massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs).
This project leverages interdisciplinary principles and considers students as co-developers to explore applications 
of teaching strategies not necessarily limited to the discipline of computer science.
